## Approach Used
***1.	Data Wrangling***
During this initial phase, the data is examined to detect any NULL or missing values, and strategies for data replacement are implemented to address and substitute these values effectively.
- Build a database
- Create a table and insert the data.
- Select columns with null values in them. Null values are not present in our database because, in creating the tables, NOT NULL was specified for each field, effectively filtering out any null values.

***2.	Feature Enginerring***
This will help us generate some new columns from existing ones.
- Add a new column named Order-Day that contains the extracted days of the week on which the order took place (Monday, Tuesday, etc). This will help answer the question of which day of the week has the most sales and profit.
- Add a new column named Month_Name that contains the extracted months of the year on which the order took place (January, Febuary, etc). This will help determine which month of the year has the most sales and profit.

***3.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)***
Conducting exploratory data analysis is essential to address the project's listed questions and objectives.
